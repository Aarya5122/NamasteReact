    * Inversion of control: When we use framework. Framework itself taked incharge of flow of application.
      That is Framework specifies when to call a library.
    * Faster Development of application
    * More code
    * Options to tweak functionality is less
    * Application should follow framework guideline

    * The code gives us new functionalities being developed in beta version which is still not standardized
    * The code file is not optimised and minified


react.production.min.js
    * The code in this file has Long Time Support enabled
    * Code in the file is more optimised and minified


8) What is async and defer?

Default case:
    * When script tag is found HTML Parsing is stopped 
    * Fetch and Executed the script tag

Async Case:
    * Script are fetched asychronously when script tag is found in HTML Parsing
